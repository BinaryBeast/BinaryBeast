# Binarybeast

This is a Ruby Gem to access the BinaryBeast.com API. It was extracted from the [Gamkoi.com](http://www.gamkoi.com) Source Code and was written by Crispin SchÃ¤ffler

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'binarybeast'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install binarybeast

## Usage

    @tourney = Binarybeast::Tournament.new

there are several options you can use when creating a tourney:

    :title => String
    :description => String
    :public => Integer
    :game_code => String
    :type_id => Integer
    :elimination => Integer
    :team_mode => Integer
    :group_count => Integer
    :teams_from_group => Integer
    :location => String
    :max_teams => Integer
    :replay_uploads => Integer
    :replay_downloads => Integer
    :auto_start => Integer
    :return_data => Integer

however, only :title => String is required for creating a new tourney object.

## Create a new Tournament on BinaryBeast

    @tourney = Binarybeast::Tournament.new(:title => "Test Tournament", :description => "This comes from a ruby gem accessing your api.")
    @tourney.create
    
## Fetching a existing Tournament from BinaryBeast

    @tourney = Binarybeast::Tournament.load(:id => "xSC21212194")

## Current implemented Functions

This is a pre release of the gem soon to be. Current functions include

    .new
    .create
    .update
    .load
    .delete
    .setBuild
    .setConfirmation
    .start
    .loadTeams

more to come soon....

## Some stuff you should know

### Eigenclass: Tourney

There is an eigenclass of the Tourney Class. Functions are

    .list
    .listPopular
    .load

### :force => true

The BinaryBeast API sends back JSON from every request. However, if you use this gem we catch the JSON Data and proccess it. If you want to have a direct response from the API you can go with something like this:

    @tourney = Binarybeast::Tournament.new(:title => "Test")
    response = @tourney.create(:force => true)
    
the :force => true tells the function to give you the callback from the binarybeast directly. The response is now a parsed hash, so this will work

    response["Result"]
    => 200

the :force options is currently available to almost every function, the exception is Binarybeast::Tourney.new since this creates the ruby object and does not do an API Call.

## Changelog

### Version: 0.1.5.pre

### Version: 0.1.4.pre

* Fixed a typo in some tests.

### Version: 0.1.3.pre
